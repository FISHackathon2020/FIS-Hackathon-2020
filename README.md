# FIS-Hackathon-2020

Problem: The nature of student engagement has changed. As company that values the talent and
ideas that college students bring, we want to ensure that we're engaging with students
on their terms. The goal of this challenge is to create a tool that will allow us to collect
valuable information about a student's experiences and interests in order to partner
through internships, co-ops, and other opportunities. In the resources listed below,
you'll find a sample dataset to use in testing your solution.


We are planning on using algorithms to try and analyze student resumes and student information to best represent their interests. Our solution is to create an app similar to tinder which allows students to go through job postings and decide whether they would like them or not.

Update: thoughts of doing a dating app for jobs, where users (college students) upload their resumes and their interests/experiences, and are matched to jobs/companies that would be interested in them.
